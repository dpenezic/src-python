# Group Management

Group management in SonarQube allows administrators to organize users into 
groups based on roles, teams, or responsibilities. This simplifies access 
control and permission management by enabling permissions to be assigned at 
the group level rather than individually. By organizing users into groups, 
SonarQube can ensure that the right people have access to the right 
projects and features.     

## Key Concepts of Group Management in SonarQube

### 1. What Are Groups?

A group is a collection of users who share similar roles or 
responsibilities within the SonarQube platform. For example, you could have 
groups for different development teams (e.g., **Frontend Team**, **Backend 
Team**, **QA Team**) or roles (e.g., **Administrators**, **Developers**, 
**Reviewers**).     

### 2. Creating and Managing Groups

Administrators can create custom groups in SonarQube to manage user access 
and permissions more effectively. Each group can have different roles, and 
members of a group will inherit those roles and permissions.    

- To create a group, navigate to **Administration > Security > Groups** and click **Create Group**.
- Once created, users can be added to the group manually or in bulk.

### 3. Assigning Roles to Groups

Groups can have roles assigned that define what actions the members of the 
group can perform in SonarQube. There are two primary types of roles: 

- **Global Roles**: These roles are applied to the entire SonarQube 
  instance (e.g., **Administrator**, **User**). 
- **Project Roles**: These roles are specific to a particular project
  (e.g.,**Developer**, **Viewer**, **Project Lead**). 

Assigning roles to groups allows for easy permission management. For 
example, you could assign the **Developer** role to a **Frontend Team** 
group, giving them access to specific functionality related to development 
but not administrative tasks.   

### 4. Permissions and Access Control

- **Global Permissions**: Such as **Administer System**, **View System**, etc.
- **Project Permissions**: Such as **Administer Project**,
  **Browse Project**, **Analyze Code**, etc. 

By associating users with groups and assigning appropriate roles, 
administrators can ensure that users have the correct level of access. 

### 5. Audit and Monitoring

SonarQube also offers audit logs to track changes related to group 
management. Administrators can monitor when users are added or removed from 
groups and see any changes made to group roles or permissions.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Custom Group

**Objective**: 
Learn how to create and manage groups in SonarQube.

**Tasks**:
1. Go to **Administration > Security > Groups**.
2. Create a new custom group (e.g., **Backend Team**).
3. Add several users to this group and assign the appropriate project 
   permissions (e.g., **Developer** role). 

---

### Exercise 2: Assign Roles to a Group

**Objective**: 
Understand how to assign roles to a group.

**Tasks**:
1. Navigate to **Administration > Security > Groups**.
2. Select an existing group (e.g., **QA Team**).
3. Assign appropriate roles such as **Viewer** or **Administer Project** 
   based on your use case. 
4. Verify the roles are properly applied by reviewing group members' 
   permissions.

### Exercise 3: Monitor Changes to Groups

**Objective**: 
Learn to track changes in group management.

**Tasks**:
1. Go to **Administration > Security > Audit Logs**.
2. Filter the logs for changes related to **Groups** (e.g., adding or 
   removing users from groups). 
3. Review the logs and confirm the changes to group management are recorded.
