# User Management

User management in SonarQube allows administrators to manage and configure the access levels of users, groups, and roles within the SonarQube platform. Effective user management ensures that the right people have the appropriate access to projects, issues, and configurations, helping maintain security and control over the development process.

## Key Concepts of User Management in SonarQube

### 1. **Users**
Users in SonarQube represent individual people who have access to the system. Users can be created either manually or via integration with external authentication systems (e.g., LDAP, SSO).

- **Admin Users**: Typically have full access to all features and administrative functions.
- **Regular Users**: Can access and analyze projects, view issues, and contribute to quality analysis, but may have limited access to system configuration settings.
- **Guest Users**: Typically have read-only access to the system and its data.

### 2. **Groups**
Groups in SonarQube are used to organize users into sets, often based on their roles in the development process. By creating groups, administrators can easily manage permissions for multiple users at once.

- **Default Groups**: SonarQube provides default groups such as `sonar-users` (for regular users) and `sonar-administrators` (for admin users).
- **Custom Groups**: Custom groups can be created to manage specific teams (e.g., frontend developers, backend developers, security experts) and their access levels.

### 3. **Roles and Permissions**
Roles define what actions users and groups can perform within SonarQube. Permissions can be granted at both the global and project levels.

- **Global Permissions**: These include administrative privileges such as managing global configurations, managing users, and configuring system-wide settings.
- **Project Permissions**: These include permissions specific to individual projects, such as viewing project dashboards, managing project configurations, and running analyses.

### 4. **Authentication and Authorization**
SonarQube supports both **internal authentication** (where user accounts are stored within SonarQube itself) and **external authentication** (via integrations such as LDAP, Active Directory, or SSO). External authentication helps centralize user management, especially in larger organizations.

### 5. **User and Group Management Interface**
Administrators can manage users and groups via the **Administration > Security > Users** and **Administration > Security > Groups** menus. From here, users can be created, edited, deleted, and assigned to various groups, and roles can be assigned to control permissions.

### 6. **Audit Logs**
SonarQube also provides audit logs that track user actions, such as login attempts, configuration changes, and permission modifications. These logs help maintain security and accountability within the platform.

## Practice Tasks for Students

### Task 1: Create a New User
- **Objective**: Learn how to create and assign roles to a new user in SonarQube.
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to **Administration > Security > Users**.
  2. Create a new user with a specific role (e.g., **Regular User** or **Administrator**).
  3. Assign this user to a project and verify the permissions they have.

---

### Task 2: Create a Custom Group
- **Objective**: Organize users into a custom group based on their roles.
- **Steps**:
  1. Go to **Administration > Security > Groups**.
  2. Create a new group (e.g., **Frontend Team**).
  3. Add users to this group and assign project-specific permissions to the group.

---

### Task 3: Configure External Authentication (LDAP or SSO)
- **Objective**: Set up an external authentication method (such as LDAP or SSO) to manage user accounts.
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to **Administration > Security > LDAP** or **SSO Configuration**.
  2. Configure the authentication settings to integrate with an external system.
  3. Test logging in with an external account to verify the integration.

---

These tasks will help students practice navigating SonarQubeâ€™s **User Management** interface, understand how to assign roles and permissions, and explore ways to integrate with external authentication systems.
